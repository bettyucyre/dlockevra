# How to Get Unbanned on Deadlock (2025 Guide) 🔓

Getting banned from Deadlock can feel like you just stepped on a digital landmine—suddenly locked out of the game you love! Whether it’s a mix-up or a *definitely-not-cheating* situation, this quick guide will help you navigate the banmaze and appeal your way back into the action.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Banned right after making a fresh Deadlock account? Or does the ban follow you no matter what alias you use? You might be slapped with an **HWID ban** (Hardware ID Ban)! Deadlock isn’t just banning accounts—it’s banning your whole rig. Sneaky stuff.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your inbox (and spam folder) for emails or Deadlock notifications explaining the ban. Typical reasons include:  
- Using cheats or unauthorized third-party programs  
- Being toxic, harassing other players, or causing a ruckus  
- Sharing accounts or suspicious account activities  

**Pro tip:** Always review Deadlock’s Terms of Service before firing off your ban appeal.

- Your Deadlock account email address  
- Your Deadlock username or gamer tag  
- The date and time when you got banned  
- Any screenshots, error messages, or warning notices
